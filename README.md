**Project 1**: Explore Weather trends analyzes local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends.

**Project 2**: The goal of the project is making the exploratory data analysis using numpy, pandas, seaborn and matplotlib library. The important thing is that we need to note down the questions first, that needs to be answered. The next step would be finding by the answers for the questions by analysing the dataset.

**Project 3**: A/B test is one of the most commonly performed analysis by data analysts and data scientists.

In this project, we will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

**Project 4**: Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, you will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling.

WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

**Project 5**:The aim of this project, data analysis is to provide a graphical summary of important features of the data set and predicting the Loan outcome in the dataset.
